## SVELT - PCAWG samples 

In order to reproduce the results of the hierarchical clustering on the PCAWG samples uploaded to SVELT, please run `clustering.py`.  The aim of the tool is to organize the PCAWG samples based on the patterns of rearrangement signatures to facilitate the process of structural variants interpretation. The samples are clustered using the Euclidean metric as a distance measure.


## Dependencies

**Python version**: 3.7.0 
**Packages**: click, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

## CLI 

The help command of the tool: 

```
python3 clustering.py  --help 
Usage: clustering.py [OPTIONS]

  Run hierarchical clustering to organize PCAWG samples on SVELT.

Options:
  --svelt_samples TEXT       SVELT samples in CSV.
  --patterns      TEXT       Patterns of structural variants TSV.
  --help                     Show this message and exit.
```

|`svelt_samples`        | List of samples used as demo data for SVELT. Cancer type is defined in the `histology_abbreviation` column. Sample UUIDs are defined in the `UUID` column. This file is available in the `data` folder        |
|`patterns`             |  Patters of somatic rearrangements.  [ref:https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32118208/. The source file is available under Supplementary Tables, Sheet 7]                                         |


## Output files

All the output results will be stored in the `SVELT_clustering/` folder.
