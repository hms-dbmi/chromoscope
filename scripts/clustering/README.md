# ðŸ“„ Hierarchical clustering of PCAWG samples 

In order to reproduce the results of hierarchical clustering on the PCAWG samples uploaded to Chromoscope, please run `clustering.py`.  The aim of the tool is to organize the PCAWG samples based on the patterns of rearrangement signatures to facilitate the process of structural variants interpretation. The samples are clustered using the Euclidean metric as a distance measure.

|       Parameter       |Description                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`chromoscope_samples`        | List of samples used as demo data for Chromoscope. Cancer type is defined in the `histology_abbreviation` column. Sample UUIDs are defined in the `UUID` column. This file is available in the `data` folder        |
|`patterns`             | Patters of somatic rearrangements.  [ref:https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32118208/. The source file is available under Supplementary Tables, Sheet 7]                                                         |


## How to reproduce the results?

Please run `run_clustering.sh`  in the `clustering` folder in order to download the file containing the information about somatic rearrangements and run the tool. This script implements the following commands:

```
PATTERNS_FILE="data/43018_2020_27_MOESM3_ESM.xlsx"
CHROMOSCOPE_SAMPLES="data/chromoscope_samples.csv"

wget -O $PATTERNS_FILE "https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs43018-020-0027-5/MediaObjects/43018_2020_27_MOESM3_ESM.xlsx"

python3 clustering.py  --chromoscope_samples $CHROMOSCOPE_SAMPLES --patterns  $PATTERNS_FILE
```

The results will be stored in a new folder `chromoscope_clustering`, see below the description of the output files.


## Output files

All the output results will be stored in the `chromoscope_clustering/` folder.
