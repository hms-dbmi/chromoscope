# Thumbnails

To enable browsing a large number of samples at scale in the cohort-level view, we generated **thumbnail images** for individual samples and use these image files. We pre-generated thumbnails for all datasets that we provide.

However, if you loaded your sample for the first time, you have to generate thumbnails. You can do this by clicking on the "Generate Missing Thumbnails" button on the top-left corner. 

These generate thumbnails will be stored on your local browser. Which means, you can safely close the browser and reopen it without losing the generated thumbnails.

?> Clicking on the "Generate Missing Thumbnails" button trigers the generation of missing thumbnails. This takes up to 10 seconds per sample.
