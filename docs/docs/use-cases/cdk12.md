# Cancers with mutations in CDK12

The CDK12 gene is a cyclin-dependent kinase and controls the cell cycle, cell division, and transcription [^1]. Cancers with pathogenic CDK12 mutations display chromosomal instability and their genomes are dominated by somatic tandem duplications [^2]. The mechanistic connection between the CDK12 loss and chromosomal instability remains unresolved, and uncovering the mechanism might inform new cancer therapies.

In order to explore the patterns of structural variants in cancers with CDK12 loss, we queried the PCAWG cancer genome dataset and created a Chromoscope configuration with 12 cancers with mutations in CDK12 likely to result in the loss of function. 

The 12 cancer genomes are dominated by large (>100kb) duplications, with the burden of structural variants higher than the CCNE1 group. This visualization also features novel and compound patterns of structural variants ([example](https://chromoscope.bio/?demoIndex=4&domain=597601479.8815027-616292105.2587856&external=https://somatic-browser-test.s3.amazonaws.com/cdk12_oncokb_sel/configs/cdk12_oncokb_sel.all.config.json)).
