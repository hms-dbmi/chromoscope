# Cancers with CCNE1 Amplifications

The CCNE1 gene is commonly amplified in different cancer types, and results in oncogenic stress [^1]. Cancers with CCNE1 amplifications often display a characteristic signature of structural variants and are dominated by somatic tandem duplications [^2]. 

In order to explore the patterns of structural variants in CCNE1-amplified cancers, we created a Chromoscope configuration with 58 cancer genomes from the PCAWG study with CCNE1 amplifications. The visualizations highlight the common tandem duplicator, and to a lesser extent, a deletion pattern that makes chromosomal instability in this tumor group. The tandem duplications are often seen in highly transcribed regions. Additionally, we can observe 'synthetic duplications' (gains delineated by translocations, [example](https://chromoscope.bio/?demoIndex=1&domain=85900031.53150788-92353184.87675776&external=https://somatic-browser-test.s3.amazonaws.com/ccne1_amp/configs/ccne1_amp.all.config.json)) and more complex structural variants ([example](https://chromoscope.bio/?demoIndex=1&domain=2675900068.904369-2724526077.5578313&external=https://somatic-browser-test.s3.amazonaws.com/ccne1_amp/configs/ccne1_amp.all.config.json).
