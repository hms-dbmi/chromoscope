# Breast Cancer Co-amplifications

The amplifications of chromosomes 8 and 11 in breast cancer co-occur. An inspection of these loci with Chromoscope shows that the amplifications are often connected by inter-chromosomal translocations, implicating derivate chromosome 8/11 as an early event in their formation [^1]. The segments of loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) adjacent to the amplicon loci are consistent with this model of amplicon origin. The visualization highlights commonalities in features of the amplicons across 23 samples, as featured in a recent study on the origin of these amplicons [^2].
