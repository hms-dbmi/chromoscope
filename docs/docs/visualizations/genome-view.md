# Genome View
The genome view shows the selected sample in a circular visualization. This uses the visual representations that are similar to the ones on the [cohort view](./cohort-view) but shows several additional tracks, such as chromosome ideograms and putative drivers.

## Interactions

- You can move or resize an interactive brush (light blue) using the mouse. This is linked with a [variant view](./variant-view) that is shown on the bottom of the genome view.
- You can move your mouse on top of a structural variant to see detailed information on a tooltip.
