# Genome Interpretation Panel

The **Genome Interpretation Panel** features a list of clinically relevant alterations, including many structural and copy number variants.  

Users can navigate to a candidate gene or region for further analysis—for example, to evaluate the pathogenicity of structural variants by examining whether a mutation is **biallelic**.  

Such distinctions are only apparent when considering different types of variants together and have been shown to predict response to therapy.  

Chromoscope also facilitates the interpretation of **amplicons and their architecture**, differentiating between amplification mechanisms that can predict evolution and therapy resistance.

## Configuration

The data for the Genome Interpretation Panel can be recorded as **additional features of the configuration file**.  

Details on how to include these data for display in the panel are provided in the [configuration documentation](https://chromoscope.bio/loading-data/through-data-config).
